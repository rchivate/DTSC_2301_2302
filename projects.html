    <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
    <p>
        Historically, the rivalry between the Indian and the Pakistani cricket teams have always been prevalent. 
        This competition is also highlighted throughout the Asia Cup. Asia Cup is a tournament that includes 
        several teams that represent different countries in the continent of Asia.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the most important actions that a captain of a cricket team makes is the coin toss. The coin toss 
        can help set up the framework for the match. If won, the captain is able to make the decision of Batting 
        or Bowling first. This decision is strategically important based on the strengths and weaknesses of the 
        two teams. Usually the tension between the two teams starts here.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project aims to determine: To what extent does winning the toss influence the final match outcome 
        for the two historically rival teams: India and Pakistan? Furthermore, I would like to explore if the 
        decision made (voluntarily or involuntarily) has a visible impact on the final outcome of the match.
    </p>

    <p>
        This relationship between the decision made after coin toss and the result of the match overall provides 
        the fans and sports analysts with data to back up claims. These claims can range from whether the coin toss, 
        associated with luck, is a determining factor in the outcome of the specific match, and how significant 
        the coin toss is to the outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because India and Pakistan are historically rivals when it comes to Cricket, it is interesting to understand 
        if something as trivial as a coin flipping in the air can set up the team for success or failure. The analysis 
        of historical data can also set up the basis for claims that fans make about the performance of a team.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    <p>
        This dataset from Kaggle has data about each individual match that was played in the Asia Cup between 
        the years of 1984 and 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each row of the dataset represents an individual match. Each team gets their own row which means that 
        there are duplicates in the matches. But the difference between the two rows is the perspective through 
        which the data is taken. For example, if there is a game between India and Pakistan, there are two rows 
        that represent the same game. One of the rows will have all the stats about the Indian team with the 
        opponent being Pakistan, while the other row will have all the statistics about the Pakistani team 
        with the opponent listed as India.
    </p>

    <p>
        The key columns and features that this research will be focused on are <strong>“Team”</strong>, 
        <strong>“Toss”</strong>, <strong>“Selection”</strong>, and <strong>“Result”</strong>. These columns are 
        necessary for the research question because it deals with the relationship between the coin toss affecting 
        the selection and the outcome of the match for the particular team.
    </p>

    <p>
        The dataset is 250 columns and 20 rows which can be interpreted as 250 matches with 20 data points 
        related to the match, four of which are mentioned earlier. This is a relatively large dataset with a lot 
        of information. Because of this, I decided to only conduct the analysis on two teams: India and Pakistan.
    </p>

    <p>
        When filtered to just India, there were 57 rows (matches). When filtered to Pakistan, there were 54 rows 
        (matches). Since the two numbers are relatively close in proximity, there will be no biases regarding 
        the outcome of the analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the dataset has a lot of detailed information about each of the matches that were played in the 
        Asia Cup, some details that could make the analysis even more accurate could be the time of day the match 
        was played, team rankings, and even dew factor since it can determine the performance of the cricket ball 
        itself which can affect the performance of teams.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another factor that is missing is the choice of toss that each of the team chose. The data jumps directly 
        to whether the team won the toss or not. Although it is not important to the performance, there could be 
        interesting trends.
    </p>

    <p>
        The dataset makes the fair weather assumption which means that all of the teams played their matches in 
        the same weather conditions. Each match is different. The weather could affect the outcome of the selection 
        that comes after the toss. Also by grouping the matches together, the dataset is assuming that the rules 
        and regulations stayed consistent across the years and the different matches.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Cleaning &amp; Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        I made notable cleaning decisions that ensured that the data was easy to read and the dataset was prepared 
        for the analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        I made sure to standardize the columns “Result” and “Toss” to make them both lowercase because of the 
        conflict of having duplicate values because of the lack of consistent capitalization. I then converted 
        each string value from these two columns (“win” and “lose”) into 1 and 0 respectively. Converting them 
        into integers will set me up for the analysis where I will be able to calculate the mean of the data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The value of the mean found by the function <code>.mean()</code> determines winning/losing percentage 
        outcomes, or the winning rate (if decimal is greater than 0.5, we can assume majority wins in the particular scenario).
    </p>

    <p>
        I also made sure to filter out the “no result” and the null rows because it does not contribute appropriately 
        to the question. No result cannot be deemed the same as winning/losing because the outcome was not determined. 
        These rows did not add value to the question because the research is only concerned with the relationship 
        between selection after toss and match results.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another decision that I made that was crucial to the research question was to make two different variables 
        that held the data of two different teams: India and Pakistan. This made it easier to analyze data because 
        the variables already had the data filtered out. Analyzing a smaller dataset is easier because there is less 
        room for error and confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
        During this part, I grouped together the results of win and win d/l, and respectively with loss, because I 
        made the assumption that the weightage of both of the results would be the same. Some tradeoffs of this 
        assumption was that the outcome of the analysis assumes that the winning/losing happened under similar 
        circumstances, rather than them being different.
